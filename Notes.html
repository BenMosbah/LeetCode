<h1><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/">World Ladder II</a></h1>
<p> I tried a DFS that got all possible paths and then chose the shortest one.
    Did not pass the time limit test. Next steps will be to try BFS which I think is more suited.
    Second time, I tried DFS. This time it relies on a while loop and at each iteration of the while loop,
    we only test chains that have the same length. This avoids looking for longer paths once paths of length k
    have been found. Unfortunately, even this was not fast enough.
    My third idea is to try a DFS again but from both ends : from the left, extending beginWord and from
    the right extending endWord. And at each time testing if we can "stick" chains together.

<p> There is a clever solution that uses zip.
